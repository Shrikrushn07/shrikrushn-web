# accurate estimation is a myth

One of the biggest blockers for developers is the urge to build the "perfect" system from day one. We obsess over architecture, scalability, and stack choices before we've even validated the core problem.

## The MVP Mindset

The goal of an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) isn't to ship a broken product—it's to ship a product with *focused value*.

1. **Define the core loop**: What is the one thing this app must do?
2. **Cut the fluff**: Do you really need dark mode in v1? Do you need multi-language support right now?
3. **Deploy early**: Use platforms like Vercel or Netlify to get a URL immediately.

## Feedback > Features

Real user feedback is infinitely more valuable than your intuition. A feature you spent weeks building might be ignored, while a small tweak you overlooked could be the key to retention.

> "If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late." – Reid Hoffman

## Conclusion

Ship code. Fix bugs. Iterate. That is the only way to build great software.
