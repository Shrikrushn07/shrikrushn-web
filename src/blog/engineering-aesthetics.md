# The "It Feels Wrong" Factor

Have you ever used an app that worked perfectly but felt... cheap? Usually, it comes down to the details.

## Motion Design

Animations shouldn't just be decoration. They should provide **context**.
- A slide-in menu tells the user *where* the navigation came from.
- A loading skeleton reduces perceived wait time.
- A button press animation confirms interaction.

In this portfolio, I used **Framer Motion** to orchestrate these interactions without bloating the codebase.

## Typography & Rhythm

Good design is 90% typography.
- **Hierarchy**: Use size and weight to guide the eye.
- **Line Height**: Give text room to breathe (usually 1.5x for body text).
- **Whitespace**: Don't fear empty space. It reduces cognitive load.

## Conclusion

As frontend engineers, we are the bridge between design and reality. Caring about these details sets apart a "good" developer from a "great" product engineer.
